# ðŸ—“ Calendar

The timeline for executing & distributing dabs from minting is as follows:

1. Mint 1,000 happens
2. Within 72 hours, a top-15 30d volume project will be selected from a random category on Open Sea by the Floorbot team.&#x20;
3. 16.5 ETH will be used to buy the floor of the selected project
4. An announcement will be made on Twitter that the selected project was dabbed
5. Within 72 hours of the above announcement, the dabbed NFT will be distributed randomly to Floorbot holders
6. When this distribution completes, an announcement will be made on Twitter & Discord

If during this timeline mint 2,000 happens, the 72-hour selection process will restart shortly after mint 1,000 distribution completes.&#x20;

If during this timeline mint 2,000 does not happen, the 72-hour selection process will start when it does.

Inexact timelines are provided to prevent holders of dabbed projects from front running Floorbot buys
